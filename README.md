# LangChain Prompt Engineering

This repository contains my hands-on practice with **prompt engineering using LangChain**.  
It includes examples of how to build and format prompts effectively for LLMs like OpenAI's GPT models.

# Topics Covered

- Using `PromptTemplate` to create structured prompts
- Working with `ChatPromptTemplate` for multi-message conversations
- Injecting dynamic variables into prompts
- Creating system, human, and AI message prompts
- Few-shot and zero-shot prompting basics
- Testing prompts with OpenAI models

### Tools Used

- Python
- LangChain

This is part of my ongoing learning journey with LangChain.  
More components like Chains, Agents, Tools, and Memory will be explored in separate repositories.
